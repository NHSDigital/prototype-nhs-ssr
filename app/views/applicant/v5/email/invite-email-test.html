        <p><strong>Application ID:</strong> 56b253f3-260a-46d4-85f5-a491f7832c41</p>

        <p>Dear...</p>
        <p>You need to complete a secure NHS online application for a Care ID.</p>
        <p>You will need a Care ID if you are starting a new role or moving to a new NHS Trust.</p>

        <p>A Care ID could be a card, security code, fob or device that will allow you to access:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>national systems</li>
          <li>clinical data</li>
          <li>patient information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to complete your application</h2>

        <p>The application has 2 parts:</p>

        <h3>1. Enter your personal information</h3>

        <p>Use a short online form to enter your personal details, including your National Insurance Number.</p>

        <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-bold">This must be completed by 9:02am Friday 29 July 2022.</p>

        <h3>2. Download the secure Verify Care ID app</h3>

        <p>When you have submitted your personal information, a link for the secure NHS Verify Care ID app will be sent to you by text message and email.</p>

        <p>Use the Verify Care ID app to submit your documents and take a passport-style photo.</p>

        <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-bold">This must be completed within 15 days of receiving the link to the app.</p>

        <h2>Documents you need</h2>

        <p>You must provide 2 photo IDs and 1 proof of address.</p>

        <h3>2 photo IDs from this list:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>UK or international passport</li>

          <li>UK Biometric residence permit card</li>
          <li>HM Armed Forces identity card</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-bold">You will need original, physical documents and expired documents will not be accepted.</p>


        <h3>1 proof of address document from this list:</h3>

        <p>Documents from joint accounts with your name and the name of 1 or more account holders can be used.</p>

        <ul>

        </ul>

        <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-bold">You will need statements or bills that have been sent to your address. Statements from online accounts will not be accepted.</p>

        <p>You can ask your bank, building society or other service provider to send a statement to you or go to a branch and ask them to print and stamp your customer record.</p>
