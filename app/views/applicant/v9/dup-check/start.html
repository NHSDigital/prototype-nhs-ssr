      <p>To check if you already have an NHS Care Identity profile, we'll:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>send a security code to your mobile phone to check that the number we have for you is correct and to make sure that you can access it</li>
        <li>ask for your full name, date of birth and national insurance number.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you do not have a profile, you will need to verify your identity to get one. </p>
