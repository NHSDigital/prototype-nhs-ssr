      <p>Our checks showed that you do not already have a Care Identity profile. You will need to apply for one. </p>

      <p>An email has been sent to you. You can use the link to return to start your application at another time.</p>

      <h2>What an NHS Care Identity is</h2>

      <p>An NHS Care ID will give you access national systems, clinical data and patient information.</p>

      <p>You need an NHS Care ID to get an authenticator, such as a smartcard.</p>

      <H2> What you'll need to provide</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>your UK address for an online check, or a paper proof of address document</li>
        <li>a photo ID, such as a passport or driving license</li>
        <li>be prepared to take a passport style photo</li>
        <li>a mobile phone with a camera and internet connection </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The next part of the application will take about 10-15 minutes to complete.</p>

      <p>You will then be prompted to download the secure Verify Care ID mobile app to photograph your ID document, take a passport style profile photo and scan your face.</p>
