      <p>If you are, for example, a student and have a term time address which differs from a non-term time address, ensure the address you use has some connections to your name.</p>
      <p>The system will be checking for connections between the address and name you provide with banks, utility providers, local council and electoral register, for example. Only you will be able to see that this check has been performed and it will not impact your credit score.</p>

      <h2 id="who">I have just moved address - should I use my old or new address</h2>

      <p>If you have only very recently changed your address, then you may use your previous address if you think that your new address in unlikely to show up any matches to your name.</p>
      <p>The system will be checking for connections between the address and name you provide with banks, utility providers, local council and electoral register, for example. Only you will be able to see that this check has been performed and it will not impact your credit score.</p>
      
      

      <h2 id="benefits">I do not have a UK address yet</h2>

      <p>If you do not have a current UK address, then do not select to verify your address through the online TransUnion check.</p>

      <p>Select ‘Provide a proof of address document’. You will have to provide a proof of address document for your non-UK address and 2 forms of photo ID. For the documents we accept, see the <a href="">Accepted documents</a> section. </p>
