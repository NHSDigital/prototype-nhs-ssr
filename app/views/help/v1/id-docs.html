      <h2 id="about">Accepted photo IDs</h2>

      <p>Passports may be expired for up to 6 months.</p>

      <p>All other photo IDs must not be expired.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Passport</li>
        <li>Driving licence (full or provisional)</li>
        <li>UK Biometric residence permit card</li>
        <li>HM Armed Forces card</li>
        <li>PASS proof of age card</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="name">My name is now different to the one presented on my ID</h2>

      <p>If your first name or last name do not match your photo IDs, we may not be able to verify your identity using the online service.</p>

      <p>Email the team managing your application to continue. You can find their email address in your invite email. </p>

      <p>The person managing your application will respond with instructions on how to continue your application.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>You may need to attend a face to face meeting</li>
      <li>You may be asked to provide other evidence of your name change, like a marriage certificate, a deed poll or a gender recognition certificate</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="expired">I do not have the correct documents or one of them has expired</h2>

      <p>If you do not have the documents then you must contact the RA manager, agent or sponsor who is managing your application. You may need to book a face-to-face appointment with them instead.</p>

      
      <h2 id="benefits">I am struggling to capture my documents through the app</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Capture the passport details page only - the first image you are asked to capture is of the passport details page only. This is the bottom half of the passport. The app will not capture the full double page and if you try to capture both, the app will not capture at all.</li>
        <li>Make sure there is no light shining on the photo ID - make sure that the photo ID details are clear and that there is no light shining on the ID that may prevent the app from reading all the information.</li>
        <li>Try a higher contrast background/surface - if you are trying to capture the photo ID against a light/white background it can prevent the app from capturing. Try holding the photo ID in front of a darker surface, this can improve the contrast and help with capturing an image.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="who">Accepted proof of address documents</h2>

      <p>If you choose not to complete the online address check, You will need 1 of the following proof of address:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bank account or credit card statement, from last 6 months</li>
        <li>Utility bill, from last 6 months</li>
        <li>Mortgage statement, from last 12 months</li>
        <li>Council tax statement, from last 12 months</li>
        <li>Tenancy agreement from the last 12 months</li>
        <li>UK Driving licence (full or provisional). If you use your driving licence as a proof of address you cannot use it as a photo ID</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We accept:</p>
            
      <ul>
        <li>statements from joint accounts if you are one of the named account holders</li>
        <li>proof of address documents from outside of the UK</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="online">Use of online bills and statements for proof of address</h2>
      <p>We accept a full screen capture of an online:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>bank statement</li>
        <li>mortgage statement</li>
        <li>council statement</li>
        <li>utility bill</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Make sure that the URL (web link), your address and the branding of the company that issued the statement are visible on the screen.</p>

      <p>You cannot use a screenshot image as the app does not support image uploads.</p>

      <p>If you only have an online statement, you will need to have your statement open on a different device, such as a computer and then use the app on your phone to capture a picture of it, as part of the application process.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you could ask your bank, building society or other service provider to send a statement to you or go to a branch and ask them to print and stamp your customer statement.</p>

      

      <h2 id="poa">Capturing a proof of address document</h2>

      <p>You must capture the full document, not just the address. We are checking that the document is legitimate so must see enough of the document to be sure of this.</p>
