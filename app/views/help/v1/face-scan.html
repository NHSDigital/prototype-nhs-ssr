      <h2 id="about">How to scan your face using the mobile app</h2>

      <p>To scan your face successfully:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>hold your phone in front of your face</li>
        <li>place your face within the green frame</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Make sure:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>there is no direct light in your eyes or shadow on your face</li>
        <li>you face forwards and place your face within the green frame</li>
        <li>no one else appears in the background</li>
      </ul>

      
      <h2 id="who">The facescan took unexpectedly, what should I do</h2>

      <p>If your facescan is still clear enough to check that your face matches the face on the photo ID documents, then this should not be a problem.</p>

      <p>If your facescan is not clear enough, then we may have to reject your application. In this case we'll let you know why, and you will have to repeat your application.</p>


      <h2 id="benefits">Which photo will be used on my smartcard</h2>

      <p>We will aim to use the photo that you have uploaded, as long as it meets professional and passport guidelines.</p>

      <p>If this does not meet these guidelines, then we would aim to use the passport photo if captured from the biometric chip or a still image captured from the facescan.</p>

      <p>If none of these presented are viable options for your smartcard photo, your application may be rejected and you will have to be re-invited to start your application again.</p>
