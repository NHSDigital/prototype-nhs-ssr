      <h2 id="esr">ESR and Apply for Care ID</h2>

      <p>If your organisation can create CIS profiles through ESR, Apply for Care ID may not provide as much benefit as for other organisations where this is not the case.</p>

      <p>Apply for Care ID does not integrate with ESR and can be seen as a different way of verifying a new member of staff’s identity in a robust way and automatically creating a profile in CIS.</p>

      <p>Where organisations do use ESR to create identities in CIS, there are sometimes other use cases in which ‘Apply for Care ID’ might be used, for example, with student onboarding.</p>

      <h2 id="hr">HR onboarding and Apply for Care ID</h2>

      <p>We are aware that there is some duplication of effort between checking an individual’s identity during the recruitment process and then verifying their identity to issue them with an authenticator.</p>

      <p>We are focused on refining and developing the technology for Apply for Care ID but are considering how, in the future, this service might be used to reduce duplication between HR onboarding and issuing authenticators.</p>

      <p>We do not have current plans to integrate with software such as Trac. The focus of our project is to verify identities to create CIS profiles for staff that need access to National clinical technology services.</p>
